          <p>
            When it comes to our sustained efforts aimed at positioning
            Brahmarupa Secondary School as an educational institution of repute,
            we start by asking ourselves some fundamental questions â€“ how can we
            prepare our students for the disruptions that is set to characterize
            the 21st Century? What specific competencies, skill sets and
            academic grounding would be required for a student to succeed in the
            frenetic pace of change that is so much a part of this day and age?
            And perhaps more importantly, how can we adequately factor in Nepali
            ground realities in our efforts aimed at achieving educational
            outcomes aligned with the imperatives demanded by the dynamism of
            the modern times and overarching national aspirations that have been
            unleashed? These questions form the broad framework within which our
            academic orientation and learning environment that we nurture here
            at Brahmarupa Secondary School are rooted. We make concerted effort
            to move beyond traditional, normative and structured approach to
            education to ensure that our students are equipped with foundational
            grounding that would set them on a course to overall success and
            achievement. In doing so, we remain committed to draw upon all the
            elements of a healthy and productive educational ecosystem
            comprising of teachers, parents and students. Our focus will not be
            on academic rigor alone but equally on other aspects of human
            attributes that play a role in helping students grow into global
            citizens. Let me take this opportunity to invite you all to be a
            part of this exciting journey. At this juncture, let me assure all
            you parents and students of our unflinching commitment for quality
            education.

          <p>
            I would like to warmly welcome all our parents and the stakeholders
            to Samriddhi school with some fundamental questions. What should
            education be like that can attune the needs of present century
            children?. Where do they belong if we fail to entail their
            competencies through our education practices? How can we enhance our
            approach to address the learner's emotions and learning behavior so
            that they can learn in the joyful environment? In what ways do we
            incorporate technology in the teaching learning process to advance
            the learners with the notions of E- safety and security? What values
            the learner needs to inculcate so that they can be courageous enough
            to deal with their own issues and contribute to a harmonious
            society? I have always carried these foundational questions in my
            mind and implemented innovative methods to enrich my pedagogical
            practice and teachers as well. Although, primary goal of any school
            is to attain academic objectives, the skills and values cannot be
            shadowed. In fact, if they develop the skills to learn, the learning
            process will take the geometrical progression that eventually leads
            to substantial academic achievement.Furthermore, the positive values
            can immensely add the utilization of the learning outcomes towards
            the self improvement and responsibility to their family, community,
            society and the globe as well.
